* Goal

Using historical data we want to get an idea about the relationship between risk and return.  In particular that =higher risk affords higher return=.  In later chapters we will see that this statement is too simplistic, and in fact only =higher systematic risk affords higher returns=.

*  Calculating Returns

To calculate returns we need to first calculate our dollar gain or loss, and then divide this by the cost of our investment.

* Average vs Geometric Returns
